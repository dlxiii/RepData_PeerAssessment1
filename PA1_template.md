9. All of the R code needed to reproduce the results (numbers, plots, etc.) in the report


```r
setwd("/Users/yulong/GitHub/RepData_PeerAssessment1")
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data

1. Unzip data to obtain a csv file.

```r
library("data.table")
library(ggplot2)

unzip("activity.zip")
```

2. Reading csv Data into Data.Table.

```r
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

1. Calculate number of setps

```r
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm = FALSE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 

head(Total_Steps, 10)
```

```
##           date steps
##  1: 2012-10-01    NA
##  2: 2012-10-02   126
##  3: 2012-10-03 11352
##  4: 2012-10-04 12116
##  5: 2012-10-05 13294
##  6: 2012-10-06 15420
##  7: 2012-10-07 11015
##  8: 2012-10-08    NA
##  9: 2012-10-09 12811
## 10: 2012-10-10  9900
```
2. Show a histogram plot of the number of steps.

```r
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) +
    geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) +
    labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

```
## Warning: Removed 8 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).
```

3. Calculate and report the results.

```r
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps, na.rm = TRUE), Median_Steps = median(steps, na.rm = TRUE))]
```

```
##    Mean_Steps Median_Steps
## 1:   10766.19        10765
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

1. Time series plot

```r
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval)] 
ggplot(IntervalDT, aes(x = interval , y = steps)) + geom_line(color="blue", size=1) + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps", x = "Interval", y = "Avg. Steps per day")
```

![](PA1_template_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

2. The maximum interval.

```r
IntervalDT[steps == max(steps), .(max_interval = interval)]
```

```
##    max_interval
## 1:          835
```

## Imputing missing values

1. Report the number of missing values.

```r
activityDT[is.na(steps), .N ]
```

```
## [1] 2304
```

```r
# alternative solution
nrow(activityDT[is.na(steps),])
```

```
## [1] 2304
```

2. Filling in missing values with median of dataset.

```r
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
```

3. Save as a new dataset with missing values filled.

```r
data.table::fwrite(x = activityDT, file = "tidyData.csv", quote = FALSE)
```

4. Plot histogram.

```r
# total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, sum)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(date)] 
# mean and median total number of steps taken per day
Total_Steps[, .(Mean_Steps = mean(steps), Median_Steps = median(steps))]
```

```
##    Mean_Steps Median_Steps
## 1:    9354.23        10395
```

```r
ggplot(Total_Steps, aes(x = steps)) + geom_histogram(fill = "blue", binwidth = 1000) + labs(title = "Daily Steps", x = "Steps", y = "Frequency")
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1. Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels ‚Äì ‚Äúweekday‚Äù and ‚Äúweekend‚Äù indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.


```r
# Just recreating activityDT from scratch then making the new factor variable. (No need to, just want to be clear on what the entire process is.) 
activityDT <- data.table::fread(input = "activity.csv")
activityDT[, date := as.POSIXct(date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")]
activityDT[, `Day of Week`:= weekdays(x = date)]
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Monday|Tuesday|Wednesday|Thursday|Friday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekday"
activityDT[grepl(pattern = "Saturday|Sunday", x = `Day of Week`), "weekday or weekend"] <- "weekend"
activityDT[, `weekday or weekend` := as.factor(`weekday or weekend`)]
head(activityDT, 10)
```

```
##     steps       date interval Day of Week weekday or weekend
##  1:    NA 2012-10-01        0      Monday            weekday
##  2:    NA 2012-10-01        5      Monday            weekday
##  3:    NA 2012-10-01       10      Monday            weekday
##  4:    NA 2012-10-01       15      Monday            weekday
##  5:    NA 2012-10-01       20      Monday            weekday
##  6:    NA 2012-10-01       25      Monday            weekday
##  7:    NA 2012-10-01       30      Monday            weekday
##  8:    NA 2012-10-01       35      Monday            weekday
##  9:    NA 2012-10-01       40      Monday            weekday
## 10:    NA 2012-10-01       45      Monday            weekday
```

2. Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. ùöùùö¢ùöôùöé = "ùöï") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.


```r
activityDT[is.na(steps), "steps"] <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, median, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps")]
IntervalDT <- activityDT[, c(lapply(.SD, mean, na.rm = TRUE)), .SDcols = c("steps"), by = .(interval, `weekday or weekend`)] 
ggplot(IntervalDT , aes(x = interval , y = steps, color=`weekday or weekend`)) + geom_line() + labs(title = "Avg. Daily Steps by Weektype", x = "Interval", y = "No. of Steps") + facet_wrap(~`weekday or weekend` , ncol = 1, nrow=2)
```
